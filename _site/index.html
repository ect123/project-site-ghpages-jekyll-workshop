<p>This workshop is meant to give you the skills to create and publish a static website using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. We’ll explore the default Jekyll installation setup and walk through the steps to customize a basic web site. We’ll cover the basic building blocks of Jekyll sites including Markdown/HTML, CSS, and Javascript and discuss best practices for organizing your content. Finally we’ll look at installing Jekyll templates for your own projects so you can customize the look and feel.</p>
