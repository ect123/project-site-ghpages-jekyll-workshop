<p>This section will introduce several concepts and tools for you to be aware of before you begin configuring and creating your site.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-static-sites">What are static sites?</h3>
<p>Static sites are websites without a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage content, aka a content management system (CMS). Examples of CMSs include Drupal, WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace. While some like this back end for administering sites, CMSs often come with technical and sometimes financial costs. They may require frequent updates to stay running and secure and a zoo of plugins in order to customize to your needs. This adds up to bogged down load time with unnecessary processes trying to run on a page.</p>

<p>Static sites come without much of the overhead that comes with a CMS. Instead they are built with human-readable markup and styling, and have the option to be extended with code like JavaScript and Python. This simple recipe is much easier for your (and your usersâ€™) web browser to load. For most small sites, this is the optimal setup for cost and functionality.</p>

<p>The one major downside to working with and maintaining statics sites is the high barrier for entry without some previous experience or knowledge with Git, the Unix Shell, HTML/CSS, and code editing. Lacking this experience, the installation process may be a bit confusing and editing might not seem productive. But with these skills, you will find that the workflows for maintaining your site intuitive and could easily fit within your other work.</p>

<p>Static sites rely on formatting and style in order to look a particular way, as well as scripts to interact with users.</p>
