<h3 id="posts-and-pages">Posts and Pages</h3>
<p>Before we add content to our site, lets go over the two basic types of content documents: posts and pages.</p>

<h4 id="posts">Posts</h4>
<p>Posts are the dynamic content that makes up your site. Often these are articles, tutorials, or some newsworthy event, but can take the form of whatever you want. Posts are published with a date – which affects their timing, relevancy, and longevity.</p>

<p>Posts should always be written in a markup language such as Markdown or HTML, and always follow the naming convention: <strong>YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post</strong>.markdown</p>

<p>Navigate to your Jekyll site directory on your computer, and open the <strong>_posts</strong> folder. Inside you should see your “welcome-to-jekyll” Markdown file. **Open that file in your code editor.</p>
