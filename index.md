# Building Project Websites with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

This workshop is meant to give you the skills to create and publish a static website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We'll explore the default Jekyll installation setup and walk through the steps to customize a basic web site. We'll cover the basic building blocks of Jekyll sites including Markdown/HTML, CSS, and Javascript and discuss best practices for organizing your content. Finally we'll look at installing Jekyll templates for your own projects so you can customize the look and feel.
