## Setting a different theme

The quickest and easiest way to change your theme for this is to use the default "Theme Chooser" in Github under "Settings > Github Pages" which comes with a small selection of well maintained default themes.

## Configuring A Custom Domain

You can also quickly and easily change the domain of your site to a custom domain that you have purchased elsewhere.

We  will not be going through this but Github has excellent documentation on [managing custom domains for github pages sites](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site){:target="_blank"}.
